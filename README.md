I completed this 'challenge' in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It has over 800 lines of CSS, 260+ lines of HTML and 120+ lines of Javascript. The code was done following a mobile first workflow.

To complete I had to:

1. Create a website based on a design file without the use of software like Figma or Adobe 
2. Using Javascript program a tab section, a FAQ section and email validation with custom error message styling (The validation built
into HTML5 forms is going to be better than any regular expression that can be put together in Javascript but overriding the default validation behavior of the form and setting a novalidate attribute on the HTML input was the only way to complete the aesthetic part of the challenge and still preserve browser functionality for things like auto-complete.)

If I had to do it all over again, I would have handled the tab section of the page programatically with Javascript instead of including 
all 3 tabs in the base HTML and using Javascript to toggle them.

I completed this 'challenge' in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It has over 800 lines of CSS, 260+ lines of HTML and 120+ lines of Javascript. It was done 'mobile first.'

After looking at the specification I understood that these were the tasks I would have

1. Create a website based on a design file without the use of software like Figma or Adobe 
2. Using Javascript program a tab section, a FAQ section and email validation with custom error message styling (The validation built
into HTML5 forms is going to be better than any regular expression that can be put together in Javascript but overriding the default validation behavior of the form and setting a novalidate attribute on the HTML input was the only way to complete the aesthetic part of the challenge and still preserve browser functionality for things like auto-complete.)

If I had to do it again I would handle the tab section of the page programatically with Javascript instead of including 
all 3 tabs in the base HTML and using Javascript to toggle them. 

I deviated from the specification on the 'active states' on some buttons due to the way adding a border on hover pushes down the elements around the button. Aesthetically it is not pleasing.

I tried different techniques like using an inset box-shadow instead of a border but that also had its own issues with layout and aesthetic.

You may view all of the design files by looking at the images in the design folder in this repository.

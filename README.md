I completed this in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It has over 800 lines of CSS, 260+ lines of HTML and 120+ lines of Javascript. It was done mobile first.

I had to:

1. Create a website based on a an image file design without the use of software like Figma or Adobe to give me exact font sizes and margins 
2. Using Javascript program a tab section, a FAQ section and email validation with custom error message styling

You may view all of the design files by looking at the images in the design folder in this repository (doing it this way will show you the entire 'specification' you are given to complete). You may also look at the specification URL below
